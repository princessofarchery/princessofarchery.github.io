the syntax is 
<br>
for ([intialization}; [condition]; [final-expression])
<br>statement
<br> intialization is a declaration of a variable
<br> the condition is an expression that need to be evaluated before loop. if this is true statement is executed, if false then skips to first execution

<br> final expression is an expression, after the loop,  it is evaluated.  Is the next thing that evaluates the condition.
<br> the statement is something that is executed if the condition is true and skipped if false.

	<br>console. log(i);
	<br>//more statements
